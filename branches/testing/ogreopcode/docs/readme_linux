There are two way of using OgreOpcode in your project. The first way is to use
it as a static library. The other way would be to use it as a dynamic library.

To build OgreOpcode as a static library just type
# make static
If you want to integrate it into your own Project just add the libOgreOpcode.a 
file when linking. You also need both include directory ./include and 
./opcode131 for the header files.

To build OgreOpcode as a dynmic library just type
# make
If you want to integrate it into your own Project you need both libraries 
libOgreOpcode.so and libOpcode.so. You also need both include directory 
./include and ./opcode131 for the header files.

Before you can build the example application you need to copy the files
ExampleApplication.h and ExampleFrameListener.h into the following directory
./example/include. Then you can build it.
# make example
if you have build OgreOpcode as a dynamic library, or
# make example_static
if you have it as a static library.

To start the example application you need to copy the Media directory from the
Samples and all the Ogre configfiles and change them to get the appropriate 
settings. You also need to download the additional mediafiles from the
OgreOpcode project.
