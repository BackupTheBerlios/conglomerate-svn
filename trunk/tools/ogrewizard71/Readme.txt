I am especially annoyed by the fact that I can't seem to convince VC to place the project in the "scripts" folder ...

Manual Install ----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Edit the OgreWizard71.vsz -> change "ABSOLUTE_PATH" to where you have unzipped this Ogre-wizard.
2) Copy the three "OgreWizard71.*" files over to your [Visual Studio]/vc7/vcprojects folder.
